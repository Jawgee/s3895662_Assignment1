				<h2>Introduction</h2>
      </div>
			<p style="text-align:center;">I was born in Australia and currently live in Melbourne. I have completed secondary school at Wellington Secondary College, and I am now in my first year of Information Technology at RMIT. I understand both Arabic and Greek to a certain degree other than English and mostly understand Arabic rather than speak it compared to Greek. I used to learn Greek at a school on Saturdays. In my spare time I enjoy gaming on my computer and from time to time have streamed on Twitch. I enjoy talking to the people I have met through the internet while streaming.</p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>Before I even started school, I knew how to use a computer through watching my father work on accounting and other work-related things. Back then I had an old computer running Windows XP and surprisingly I was able to use peripherals to navigate through the computer and even knew how to mess around with the control panel and do things most other kids my age didn’t know how to do. Since then, I’ve been interested in computers and IT and enjoy troubleshooting issues people may have with their computers. I personally have limited knowledge in programming and other software-based endeavours. I have done the bare basics in HTML programming in high school. I have messed around with the R programming language but to a small degree and have no knowledge of it now. I have also done basic database management with MS Access.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
					<p>I chose RMIT because I have heard from a friend whose father teaches at universities that this university is especially good for IT. It is also a very well-known university with multiple campuses worldwide. They also have many facilities such as restaurants and study areas and overall, it’s a very cleanly environment.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Expectations</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn a large variety of skills in order to do what I would like to do in IT. Learning multiple skills such as design, programming and conventions in IT will enable me to pick up most IT positions out there. The fact that this program is very broad allows me to figure out what I would then like to specialise in that interests me. In more precise fashion I expect to learn different programming languages and techniques of design.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>In this position I will be providing extensive analysis of current systems and design solutions within the Integration Platform. An integration platform is software which helps with the integration of different services. It helps create an environment for engineers. The position includes IT solution design and development, change management and implementation, application support and managing integration platform security. I will be working with Fire Rescue Victoria which interests me because I do enjoy helping people and being able to make systems more efficient means that more emergencies will be averted. As I have said earlier, I enjoy troubleshooting people’s issues and try to help them as much as I can and with this position, I will be able to make a significant impact to the way the fire service operates. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Skills I need</h3>
					<p>For this position I will need extensive experience in designing and developing integration solutions as well as well-developed interpersonal skills and report writing ability. I will also need to demonstrate sound conceptual and analytical skills and be able to set well-defined and realistic personal goals. The qualifications I must have include a computer science, information systems, or related degree. I must also have an integration solution design and development certification and an ITIL framework (certification on Foundation level is preferred, but not essential).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>I currently have little to no experience in the workforce and have only completed High school. I have little experience in basic HTML and R programming. Also, I have a slight understanding of DBMS’s. I have the ability to communicate clearly with a team and enjoy teamwork-based work.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>To be able to obtain the skills required for this position I believe that I will need to work on my ability to set clear and concise goals and manage stress and pressure better. I will then focus on growing my programming skills and build on my current knowledge of concepts. I will of course need to complete a relevant degree for this job which I currently am. Then I will need to obtain an integration solution design and development certification (i.e., Microsoft, MuleSoft etc). and an ITIL framework certification but isn’t essential.</p>

					<h4>Strengths</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>- Charming</dt>
						<dd>People with the Adventurer personality type are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.</dd>
						<dt>- Sensitive to Others</dt>
						<dd>Adventurers easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize conflict.</dd>
						<dt>- Imaginative</dt>
						<dd>Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.</dd>
						<dt>- Passionate</dt>
						<dd>Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.</dd>
						<dt>- Curious</dt>
						<dd>Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward – if Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so.</dd>
						<dt>- Artistic</dt>
						<dd>Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience.</dd>
					</dl>
				</section>
				<br>
				<section>
					<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>- Fiercely Independent</dt>
						<dd>Freedom of expression is often Adventurers’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge.</dd>
						<dt>- Unpredictable</dt>
						<dd>Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.</dd>
						<dt>- Easily Stressed</dt>
						<dd>Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favour of gnashing teeth.</dd>
						<dt>- Overly Competitive</dt>
						<dd>Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.</dd>
						<dt>- Fluctuating Self-Esteem</dt>
						<dd>It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with Adventurers’ strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.</dd>
					</dl>
				</section>
				<br>
				<section>
					<h4>Team Composition</h4>
					<p>Among their peers Adventurers feel most comfortable. Working with equals and giving some advice in order to solve practical problems is right where Adventurer personalities like to be. While they may exhaust themselves if their role requires an excessive amount of social interaction, they are otherwise quite charming and have excellent networking skills.</p>
				</section>
				<br>
				<br>
				<section>
					<h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>
					<p>This will test what sort of learning style you have. Whether you are a visual, auditory, or tactile learner.</p>
				</section>
				<img src="img/learning.png"
					height="200"
					width="500">
				<section>
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
					<p>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>

					<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
					<p>This test takes into consideration, five factors that will determine your overall personality.</p>
				</section>
				<img src="img/big_five.png"
					height="200"
					width="500">
				<section>
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p>I scored low in factor 1 meaning that I am quite introverted and a “shut in”. I scored low in factor 2 meaning that I am emotionally unstable meaning my mood can change quite quickly from a happy to a sad one. I scored high in factor 3 meaning that I am quite friendly and optimistic. I scored low in factor 4 meaning that I am impulsive and disorganised. I scored relatively low in factor 5 meaning that I tend to be traditional and conventional.</p>
				</section>
				<br>
				<br>
				<section>
					<h3>Analysis of overall results</h3>
					<p>Looking at these results it seems like I’m more of a visual learner and usually am an emotional person and tend to enjoy teamwork. I have noticed from these tests that I am very much an introvert and that I can take criticism harshly. These results shows that in a team I am able to communicate well and understand how people are doing on tasks. I will also be quite imaginative with devising a solution to a problem and can share my thoughts with other team members. With this information I will form a team with other like-minded people that are also good with teamwork and are talkative. Since I will be more likely to get stressed with large tasks, with the support of other team members I can combat this and get the job done.</p>

				<h2>Project</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>My IT project idea is a portable water quality sensor and temperature sensor. This device will allow average people to test the quality of possibly contaminated water or stream water in order to prevent any complications that may arise with the use of the water in question. It will also contain a temperature sensor as a bonus in the case of needing specific temperatures for certain projects. Finding out the quality of water may help with understanding how different events affect the quality of water sources and then further finding solutions to stop the pollution of these waters.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>“Some 80 percent of the world’s wastewater is dumped—largely untreated—back into the environment, polluting rivers, lakes, and oceans.” So, it is very important that we are able to test the water in local streams and other water sources to prevent the consumption or use of untreated or polluted water. This project will be useful for casual detection of pollutants that may be in water sources. As I have some experience using Arduino technology, this might be relatively easy to create. It should also be cheap as parts are small and easy to use.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This product will feature a conductivity sensor which will test the purity of the water (more ionic materials in the water will raise conductivity), a temperature sensor that will measure the temperature of the water and the information will be displayed on a seven-segment display or an LCD display. To create a conductivity sensor, a plastic tube or something similar will be used with two wires soldered to nichrome wires on opposite sides of the tube. Electrical tape will be used to cover the wires for safety and a bit of the wires will be exposed to be used. The other ends of the wires will be plugged into the Arduino board and a 9V battery will be connected in order to be made portable. Most streams have a conductivity between 0.05 and 1.5 volts with freshwater streams between 0.15 and 0.5 volts. The voltage readings will be shown on a connected laptop.</p>
				</section>
				<section>

				</section>
				<br>
				<section>
					<p>As for the temperature sensor, it will be soldered to some wires which will be plugged into a breadboard. A seven-segment display will also be connected and possibly an LCD display (it may be difficult to use an LCD display to display this information mainly for the fact that there will need to be a lot of soldering). The seven-segment display will display the temperature of the water when the temperature sensor is placed in the water.</p>
				</section>
				<br>
				<section>
					<p>A possible case might be either laser cut or 3d printed big enough to hold all the parts with both conductivity and temperature sensor exposed from two holes in the case. Also, the way things would need to fit in the case would need to be considered since parts shouldn’t be damaged from shaking the case around and should be seated with little movement. I’d imagine that it would be convenient to be able to open the case quite easily so a possible click system can be made or even drilling in screws and unscrewing them when access is needed will suffice if a click system is not possible/too difficult. If implementing an LCD display it may be hard to manage space in the case as it will need to be specifically in a position and a hole must be cut for it.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<img src="img/case.png"

				</section>
				<br>
				<section>
					<p>There is a possibility that more batteries can be connected if the device loses power quite quickly. However, I imagine something as simple as this device wouldn’t require much power but if the device were to be left running for extended periods of time it may be smart to include a battery pack.</p>
					<p>There has also been some thought into using a turbidity sensor rather than a conductivity sensor for the shear fact that it detects the total suspended solids in the water and is a direct indicator of polluted water compared to the conductivity only indicating how “pure” the water is which in turn can still determine the pollution of water to a certain degree.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					<p>The software that will be used is the Arduino IDE which is written in C++ and will be what I will use to code the program and save it onto an Arduino board to execute the desired outcome. I will require a plastic rod or tube for the conductivity sensor and different connectors and Nichrome wire. I will also require a soldering iron to solder wires together. A DS18B20 temperature sensor will also be used which is also waterproof which is required for detecting the temperature of the water. A breadboard will also be needed to connect a seven-segment display or an LCD display which will display results in real time. A turbidity sensor may also be used for the detection of pollutants if the makeshift conductivity sensor is not enough. Possibly need a laser cutter or a 3d printer to create a case for the parts. Various tools for building the case might be needed as well.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>I would need to have sound knowledge in using the Arduino software to code the program which I have a fair amount of knowledge on how to use it. I would also need to know how to physically connect parts properly in order to avoid any faults and ultimately make the circuit work as intended. It is relatively easy to find example codes from the Arduino website if assistance for understanding how a part works. Overall, I may need to brush up on my skills using the Arduino technology.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>Ultimately the outcome of this project is to effectively identify the quality of different water sources and their temperatures. This will allow for further understanding as to why and how the quality of the water is this way. But not only will this project help identify the quality of water but will allow a portable solution for any individual to carry with them. This project will ensure that there will be less safety issues with the consumption and overall use of water in streams and other places.</p>
